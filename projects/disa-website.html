        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Company &amp; Requirements</h3>
        <p>Disa Technologies, Inc. is a US-based start-up in the software development industry. Their mobile app &ldquo;Disa Unified Messenger&rdquo; had an existing website and landing page which was in need of a refresh. I had built a rapport with the team as an alpha/beta tester of the application and offered to take on the Web Developer role.</p>
        <p>The company required an updated version of their main website. The company did not have a product style guide to base any new designs from so I was also required to create one from their existing content and branding (logos and the app itself). At the start of the project there were a number of important pages missing from the site, such as those for Downloads, an FAQ and Press Enquiries.</p>

        <h3>Solution &amp; Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>The existing website was a static site built in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (plus JQuery). There was no dynamic content on the site so I continued to use the existing technology stack, rather than moving the site to a CMS or using a front-end framework like React.js.</p>
        <p>I did however take full advantage of the Bootstrap CSS framework to unify the look of the website. Bootstrap also helped me to improve the overall responsiveness of the page layouts with its 12-column grid system and mobile-first design approach.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The website required a &lsquo;changelog&rsquo; for the mobile app which was to be kept in sync with the Github releases section. This meant whenever a new version of the app was released it would need to be reflected on the website. When users of the app opened it after an update they were to be greeted by the latest changelog from the website.</p>
        <p>Alongside the main website this also meant developing a tool that could take the Jira (Atlassian) info relating to the latest update and turn it into xml which would be read by a script on the &lsquo;changelog&rsquo; page when it loaded. This involved working with the Jira API to query new app releases, access their changelogs and convert the response data into an xml element.</p>
        <p>If I encountered this particular challenge again, I would take advantage of a modern JavaScript framework to handle the XML data loading, html element creation and interactions. I would also store the changelog data in a CMS for ease of updating and access by the company.</p>
