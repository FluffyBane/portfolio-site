        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Company &amp; Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          LSD Associates are a full-service design organization. They were looking for a portfolio website to present
          their architecture and interior design projects in a sleek, modern style. When I took on this project it had
          already been decided that the website would use <strong>WordPress</strong> and a custom theme designed for portfolios
          called <strong>Aalto</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Their requirements for the website were:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>a comprehensive portfolio of their design projects broken up into categories with dedicated pages for each portfolio item</li>
            <li>a custom jumbotron with the project&rsquo;s featured image and title on each page</li>
            <li>an easy to edit template for the project pages - drag and drop content switching (no programming needed)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Solution &amp; Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>
          The extensive WordPress plugin library came in handy when looking for solutions to the project requirements.
          The <strong>WPBakery Page Builder</strong> was the tool of choice for content creation and it was very easy to create
          custom page layouts quickly. A plugin to control access to some private projects was required so I selected
          <strong>Profile Builder</strong> which allows you to create rules for each login type that WordPress defines. Within the
          project pages there was then an option to mark the page as only visible when the viewer was logged in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project page header (featured image and title) was created for each using <strong>Slider Revolution.</strong> This
          plugin allows the creation and editing of custom sliders/image carousels which are turned into WordPress
          shortcodes for easy inclusion in any page of the site. The custom template for project pages was created with
          WPBakery and some dummy content left to indicate where to drop images, meta data and assign a category to the
          project.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Part of the challenge involved in creating the template was automatically displaying some project meta data
          (team, status and category). This required another custom shortcode created using <strong>PHP</strong> to extract the
          information from the &ldquo;page meta&rdquo; attribute and create a custom <strong>HTML</strong> output for the data within
          the project page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance was the biggest hurdle in getting the website up and running. With so many high quality images on
          display on every page it was crucial that they be optimized and loaded asynchronously so as to obtain the
          desired loading time. <strong>WP Rocket</strong> helped to lazy-load any image that did not appear &ldquo;above the
          fold&rdquo; as well as minifying the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files of the site. Then I used <strong>EWWW Image
          Optimizer</strong> to convert all of the images uploaded to the site into highly compressed WEBP format.
