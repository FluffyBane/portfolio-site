      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I have always liked being creative and building things. Those things are usually built for the internet, though
        they used to be made of Lego. Ah, simpler times.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have ever played with Lego (and you probably have, as there are approximately 62 Lego bricks for every
        person on Earth) you’ll know that it usually requires patience, problem-solving and nimble fingers. Luckily,
        these qualities translate nicely into a career in web design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest sparked in school, where we created some of the most basic web pages you could imagine. But even
        these projects gave me a glimpse at the true power that HTML and CSS possessed. We did not even touch on
        JavaScript!
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not until much later that I was creating websites professionally. I had dabbled in video game development
        for some years but ultimately did not find it fulfilling. During this time, I started working with a US-based
        start-up, Disa Technologies. Their website needed a spruce-up, which was the perfect opportunity to dive
        headfirst into web development. I taught myself everything I needed for that project by following tutorials,
        breaking things, and doing a lot of late-night googling!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked on a few side projects for friends and family that required getting familiar with WordPress
        and PHP.

    <section id="skills">
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>
        The core skills I use every day are, of course, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (compiled from
        SASS). These are the fundamental aspects of any website or web application. I do my best to keep up with
        recent industry trends by exploring CSS frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>,
        <strong>Materialize</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind.</strong> The responsiveness and accessibility of websites
        across all devices are vital so I&rsquo;m frequently expanding my knowledge of new specifications, like Flexbox
        and the CSS Grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am adept at utilising <strong>JavaScript</strong> to bring life to my web projects. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll
        rely on the speed and efficiency of <strong>JQuery</strong> to implement some small, simple interactions but
        I&rsquo;m just as comfortable working in plain JavaScript. I also like to use <strong>Node.js</strong> behind
        the scenes when working with task runners, like <strong>Grunt</strong> and <strong>Gulp</strong>, which help to
        automate the development workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP-based <strong>WordPress</strong> has featured in a few side projects I&rsquo;ve worked on for
        friends and family. While I admire the streamlined setup process and ease of use of a standard WordPress
        website, I have also used <strong>PHP</strong> to add extra functionality to those projects in the form of
        custom page templates and navigation menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most, I use <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> as my version control system. This pairs
        nicely with my code editor of choice <strong>VS Code</strong> where I can see all of my recent changes, fix
        merge conflicts, and stage commits without having to leave the editor.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Figma</strong> is my favourite tool for both graphic design and web design.
        I&rsquo;ve also used it to create and maintain brand style guides. This usage includes creating atomic elements
        of design like fonts and colors as well as modules like buttons, form elements, and menus.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach to web design is to build <strong>wireframes</strong> of each of the required pages using the
        design elements established in the style guide and then <strong>prototype</strong> several variations by
        applying the brand styles until myself (and the client) are happy.
