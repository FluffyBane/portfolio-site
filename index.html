      <section id="about">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I've always liked being creative and building things. Those things are usually built for the internet these
          days, though they used to mostly be built out of Lego. Ah, simpler times.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&rsquo;ve ever played with Lego (and statistically you probably have as there are approximately 62 Lego
          bricks for every person on the planet today) you&rsquo;ll know that it usually requires patience, problem
          solving and nimble fingers. Luckily for me these qualities translated nicely into a career web design and
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest was sparked in school creating the simplest web pages you could imagine. But even these small
          projects gave me a glimpse at the true power that HTML and CSS possessed. We didn&rsquo;t even touch on
          JavaScript!
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn&rsquo;t until much later though that I was creating websites professionally. I had dabbled in video
          games development for a number of years but ultimately did not find it to be fulfilling. It was during this
          time however that I started working with a US-based start-up, Disa Technologies. Their website was in need of
          a spruce up and it was the perfect opportunity to dive headfirst back into web development. I taught myself
          everything I needed for that project by following tutorials, breaking things and doing a lot of late-night
          googling!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also worked on a few interesting side projects for friends and family that required getting familiar
          with WordPress and PHP.
        </p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ll let you get back to looking at the rest of the page now. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

      <section id="skills">
        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          The core skills I use every day are, of course, <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (compiled from
          SASS). These are the fundamental aspects of any website or web application. I do my best to keep up with
          recent industry trends by exploring CSS frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong>,
          <strong>Materialize</strong> and <strong>Tailwind.</strong> The responsiveness and accessibility of websites
          across all devices is vital so I&rsquo;m always expanding my knowledge of new specifications, like Flexbox and
          the CSS Grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am adept at utilising <strong>JavaScript</strong> to bring life to my web projects. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll
          rely on the speed and efficiency of <strong>JQuery</strong> to implement some small, simple interactions but
          I&rsquo;m just as comfortable working in plain JavaScript. I also like to use <strong>Node.js</strong> behind
          the scenes when working with task runners, like <strong>Grunt</strong> and <strong>Gulp</strong>, that help to
          automate the development workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP-based <strong>WordPress</strong> has featured in a couple of side projects I&rsquo;ve worked on for
          friends and family. While I admire the streamlined setup process and ease-of-use of a standard WordPress
          website, I have also used <strong>PHP</strong> to add extra functionality to those projects in the form of
          custom page templates and navigation menus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most I also use <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> as my version control system. This pairs
          nicely with my code editor of choice <strong>VS Code</strong> where I can see all of my recent changes, fix
          merge conflicts and stage commits without having to leave the editor.
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Figma</strong> is my favourite design tool. I use it for both graphic design and web design.
          I&rsquo;ve also used it to create and maintain brand style guides. This includes the atomic elements of design
          like fonts and colors as well as modules like buttons, form elements and menus.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to web design is to build <strong>wireframes</strong> of each of the required pages using the
          design elements established in the style guide and then <strong>prototype</strong> several variations of the
          designs by applying the brand styles until myself (and the client) are happy.
