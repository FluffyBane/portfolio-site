        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Company &amp; Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Canary Woodworking are a father and son team based in the UK who produce hand-made wooden products. They had
          previously been selling them through their Facebook page and at craft fairs. Canary were looking for an
          e-commerce solution that they could completely control, and easily update and manage themselves. They did not
          have an existing style guide so I created one based on the colours in their logo in combination with natural
          greens and browns representing the natural elements of their woodwork.
        </p>
        <p>Their requirements for the website were:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>an online store where they could display product listings across multiple categories including detailed
              product specifications</li>
            <li>the ability to handle digital payments through the store - an automated solution to
              calculate postage and packaging for one or more items in an order</li>
            <li>an affordable web hosting plan</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Solution &amp; Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>
          I felt the obvious choice for the store was a <strong>Wordpress</strong> website, with e-commerce functionality provided by
          <strong>WooCommerce</strong>. The site uses the e-commerce focused Orchid theme which came with custom elements that were
          extremely helpful in setting up the product listing and categories pages. Each of the custom pages was built
          in the <strong>Elementor</strong> page builder.
        </p>
        <p>
          WooCommerce handles user account creation and the full process of purchasing items from the website from
          registration to checkout. The company wished to also offer local delivery options at checkout so I added the
          WooCommerce Delivery and WooCommerce Royal Mail plugins to manage delivery areas, timeslot pickers and postage
          calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website is hosted on <strong>SiteGround</strong> which offers a suite of productivity and security features on the
          current plan including daily/weekly backups of the full site.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The challenges faced in completing this project were mostly due to WordPress&rsquo; well-documented list of
          little quirks. For example creating a custom CSS stylesheet in order to theme the user login / account area to
          match the rest of the site and load it in a <strong>PHP function</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of the service the company offers is custom text engravings on its products. This required another handy
          plugin called <strong>Advanced Product Fields</strong> which allowed me to create a custom message field that the customer
          can fill in when adding the product to their cart. The message shows up on their invoice for their own peace
          of mind and is passed on to the company as part of their WooCommerce order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I created a custom PHP function to display a product enquiry form when the price is set to zero (out
          of stock or only custom orders) and a button to access it from the product listing. <strong>JQuery</strong> was also used
          to scroll the page and focus on the form.
